# 16:1  MULTIPLEXER  USING VERILOG

## AIM :
   To implement 16:1  multiplexer using verilog and validate its outputs
   
## HARDWARE REQUIRED : 
   â€“ PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher  
   
## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
   Quartus prime  
   
## THEORY :   

### What is a Multiplexer ?
    
  The multiplexer is a device that has multiple inputs and single line output. The select lines determine which input is connected to the output, and also increase the amount of data that can be sent over a network within a certain time. It is also called a data selector.

  The single-pole multi-position switch is a simple example of a non-electronic circuit of the multiplexer, and it is widely used in many electronic circuits. The multiplexer is used to perform high-speed switching and is constructed by electronic components.
